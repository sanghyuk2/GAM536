max script - 3ds Max programming language

It's index starts from 1 not 0.

'a = on' === 'a = true'

'box()' makes an box in 3ds max
'box pos: [0,0,100]' - you can make a box with certain position

If you create a object, then what the macros shows is 
1. object type
2. object position (vector)
3. isSelected:on - UI thing
4. width
5. length
6. height

max script is not case-sensitive langauge.

$ - current selected object
wirecolor = color 27 177 27 

To change the object color, you should put $ in front of the object name
ex) $Box001.wirecolor = blue

If statement
ex) 
if a != b do
something

if (a == b) then
sphere()
else
cone()

Instead of using a curly braket, use round braket


case statement
ex)
case of (

(a == 0): box()
(a == 1): sphere()
(a == 5): cone()

)

if the code does not work, open a new script and do save as, and run the code by cliking evaluate all which is under the tool.
Ctrl + E - short cut to run the max script.

For loop statement
if you do 'for i = 1 to 10', it means it includes both 1 and 10 

ex)
delete objects //by putting this, it erase all the objects before you start the code.

for i = 1 to 10 do(
	box pos:[i*100,0,0]
)

for i = 1 to 10 by 2 do(
		box pos:[0,i*100,0]
)
x=1
for i = 1 to 10 while x <3 do(
	box pos:[0,0,i*100]
	x=x+1
)

functions - in 3ds max script the functions are declared by 'fn' or 'function'
ex)
function drawCones numCones = (
	
	coneRadius = 25*numCones
	for i = 1 to numCones do(
		cone pos:[0,0,(i-1)*100] height: 100 radius1:coneRadius
		coneRadius = coneRadius-25
	)
)

function main = (
	delete objects
	drawCones(5)
)

main()


-------------------
random -5 5 - it returns the integer value between -5, 5

on the practice making a blade of grass, if you do see like a pencil, then change the mode from default to model assist.
